<section class="history">
  <h2>How I Started...</h2>
  <p>
    It began in the quiet corners of Chennai, where the hum of machinery and the
    weight of expectations pressed down on me like a monsoon sky. I was a
    mechanical engineering student, tethered to a path chosen by practicality,
    not passion. Every blueprint I drafted felt like a silent betrayal of the
    code I secretly scribbled in margins lines of Java and Python that whispered
    of a world beyond gears and tolerances. But in India, stability was a god,
    and dreams were its sacrifice. My first internship in Singapore as an Oracle
    Database Engineer was both a lifeline and a loneliness. At 22, I navigated
    foreign streets and foreign systems, my broken English echoing in empty
    office corridors. I spent nights hunched over databases, debugging stored
    procedures until my eyes burned, while my peers back home celebrated
    festivals I could only watch through pixelated video calls. The migraines
    came often, but the fear of failure came harder. At KloudOne Technologies,
    the storms raged louder. I scrubbed SonarQube warnings until 3 AM, my hands
    trembling from caffeine and cortisol. Migrating Postgres to MongoDB felt
    like performing heart surgery blindfolded. Then came Orion Innovation, where
    legacy systems older than I was became my battleground. For months, I
    rewrote crumbling frameworks in Spring Boot and AngularJS, racing against
    sleepless nights and a voice that hissed, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here.‚Äù When we
    slashed system downtime by 30%, the victory was hollow at first measured in
    deadlines met, not moments lived. But slowly, the code began to sing. The
    cruelest blow came in Boston. Pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Business Analytics
    while working full-time, I became a ghost in two worlds. I‚Äôd sprint from
    lectures to code reviews, surviving on vending machine snacks and 20-minute
    naps. Yet here I am. The boy who once hid his coding notebooks beneath
    engineering textbooks now architects microservices that power thousands. The
    intern who stammered through meetings in Singapore holds AWS certifications
    and leads deployments with Docker and Kubernetes. The student who collapsed
    in libraries is now a data analyst, transforming chaos into clarity with
    Tableau and Power BI. The scars? They‚Äôre still there the migraines, the
    guilt of missed moments, the echo of that voice saying ‚Äúnot enough.‚Äù But
    they‚Äôre outshone by the glow of dashboards I‚Äôve built, the hum of systems
    I‚Äôve optimized, and the quiet pride of a man who turned every ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù
    into ‚ÄúI did it.‚Äù The journey isn‚Äôt pretty. But it‚Äôs mine. And somewhere in
    the code and the chaos, I found not just a career but a voice.
